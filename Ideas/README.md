Future Project Ideas and Notes that I may take up in the future

## petition.parliament.uk/petitions signer bot

A web scraper and bot that can automatically sign x number of times a specific permission.
Existing [bots like this](https://github.com/search?q=petition+bot&type=Repositories) do exist but none for https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions (that I've seen).

## Vulnerability Report Scraper from CVE Mitre, Nessus, etc

A tool that will scrape information from the internet on a CVE and format it into a nice vulnerability finding template so pen testers never have to write long convoluted vulnerability findings again (theoretically)
