Future Project Ideas and Notes that I may take up in the future

## petition.parliament.uk/petitions signer bot

A web scraper and bot that can automatically sign x number of times a specific permission.
Existing [bots like this](https://github.com/search?q=petition+bot&type=Repositories) do exist but none for https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions (that I've seen).

## /etc/shadow to Hashcat format coverter

Converter tool that turns an `/etc/shadow` file into several hashcat files ready for cracking, saves time copying each and every hash over.
